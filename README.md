# Advent of Code solutions 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! 
This is where I’ll be sharing my solutions to the puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). 
I’m using **C++** for all my solutions this year as I want more practice for upcoming projects I’ll be working on next year.

## Repo Structure

I’m using a single `CMakeLists.txt` to manage the project, with each day set up as a separate target.

```
📁 AOC2024/
├── 📁 src/
|   ├── 📁 day-1/
│   |   └── input.txt      # Input for Day 1
|   ├── 📁 day-2/
│   |   └── input.txt      # Input for Day 2
|   └── ...
├── 📁 src/
|   ├── 📁 day-1/
│   |   └── main.cpp       # Solution for Day 1
|   ├── 📁 day-2/
│   │   └── main.cpp       # Solution for Day 2
│   └── ...
└── CMakeLists.txt     # Manages all days
```
